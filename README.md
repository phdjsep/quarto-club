# Welcome to QMD Club!

Hi! We started this website to help showcase the many amazing websites that can be created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Feel free to look around and get inspired!

## How to add your site to the club?

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a folder inside of the `/showcase` folder
3. Add an `index.qmd` file to your newly created folder
4. The header of your `index.qmd` file should follow this example (feel free to add as many categories as you see fit):

```{.yaml filename="index.qmd"}

## Notes

#### 2025-10-06
It's been a while, but [qmdclub.com](https://www.qmdclub.com) is the active page where you can find all the awesome contributions.

#### 2023-10-07
At the moment the url for the site is [quarto.club](quarto.club), but we're moving to [qmdclub.com](qmdclub.com) in order to adhere to the [Quarto Trademark Policy](https://quarto.org/trademark.html). Unfortunately, qmdclub.com was registered with Squarespace (who's taken over from Google Domains) and we've been having a poor experience with them, but we have to wait 60 days before we can transfer the name to another provider. We'll update this repo when we've made the switch.
